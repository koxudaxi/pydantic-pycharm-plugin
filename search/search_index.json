Please use it in 0.1.2 or later. Tips This plugin supports type-checking to pydantic with a built-in type checker. Plus, this type-checker supplies a special feature to pydnatic. This plugin provides a type-checker for pydantic. You can use the type-checker on PyCharm's Settings (Preference -> Editor -> Inspections -> Type checker compatible with Pydantic ) This type-checker inherits from PyCharm's built-in type checker (aka Type checker ). Please disable Type checker when you enable Type checker compatible with Pydantic. Don't use this type checker with a builtin type checker same time. Parsable Type \ud83d\udd17 Pydantic has lots of support for coercing types. However, PyCharm gives a message saying only Expected type \"x,\" got \"y\" instead: When you set parsable-type on a type, then the message will be changed to Field is of type \"x\", \"y\" may not be parsable to \"x\" Set parsable-type in pyproject.toml \ud83d\udd17 You should create pyproject.toml in your project root. And, you define parsable-type like a example. exapmle: pyproject.toml [tool.pydantic-pycharm-plugin.parsable-types] # str field may parse int and float str = [\"int\", \"float\"] # datetime.datetime field may parse int \"datetime.datetime\" = [ \"int\" ] # your_module.your_type field may parse str \"your_module.your_type\" = [ \"str\" ] [tool.pydantic-pycharm-plugin] # You can set higlith level (default is \"warning\") # You can select it from \"warning\", \"weak_warning\", \"disable\" parsable-type-highlight = \"warning\" ## If you set acceptable-type-highlight then, you have to set it at same depth. acceptable-type-highlight = \"disable\" Acceptable Type \ud83d\udd17 Info This feature is in version 0.1.3 or later. Pydantic can always parse a few types to other types. For example, int to str . It always succeeds. You can set it as an acceptable type. The message is Field is of type 'x', 'y' is set as an acceptable type in pyproject.toml . Also,You may want to disable the message.You can do it, by setting \"disable\" on acceptable-type-highlight . Set acceptable-type in pyproject.toml \ud83d\udd17 You should create pyproject.toml in your project root.
